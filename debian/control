Description: JBIG2 encoder
 JBIG2 encodes bitonal (1 bpp) images using a number of clever tricks to get
 better compression than G4. This encoder can:
 .
  * generate JBIG2 files, or fragments for embedding in PDFs,
  * generic region encoding,
  * perform symbol extraction, classification and text region coding,
  * perform refinement coding and,
  * compress multipage documents.

  * generate JBIG2 files, or fragments for embedding in PDFs,
  * generic region encoding,
  * perform symbol extraction, classification and text region coding,
  * perform refinement coding and,
  * compress multipage documents.

Description: Python script to convert jbig2 files to PDF files
 This package contains a script called pdf.py (FIXME: bad name) that is
 meant to "join" all the JBIG2 files generated by jbig2(enc) in a single PDF
 file.
 .
 If multiple files are converted at the same time, their commonalities
 (e.g., the shapes of letters) are stored in a symbol dictionary that this
 script can use to make the PDF files competitive even with alternative
 formats meant for scanned documents (e.g., DjVu files).
